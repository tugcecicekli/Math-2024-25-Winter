        "\n",
        "A **Taylor series** is an infinite series expansion of a function around a point. It provides an approximation of a function as a sum of its derivatives at a specific point, multiplied by powers of the input variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **General Form of Taylor Series**\n",
        "Given a function $f(x)$, the Taylor series expansion of $f(x)$ around a point $a$ is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x) = f(a) + \\frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x - a) + \\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \\cdots$\n",
        "\n",
        "Or, in summation notation:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x - a)^n$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $f^{(n)}(a)$ is the $n$-th derivative of $f$ evaluated at $x = a$\n",
        "- $(x - a)^n$ is the power of $(x - a)$\n",
        "- $n!$ is the factorial of $n$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Key Components of Taylor Series**\n",
        "- **$a$**: The point around which the series is expanded (often taken as $a = 0$, leading to the **Maclaurin series**).\n",
        "- **Derivatives**: The coefficients of each term are determined by the derivatives of $f(x)$ at the point $a$.\n",
        "- **Factorial terms**: The factorial in the denominator normalizes the series for each term.\n",
        "  \n",
        "#### 3. **Maclaurin Series**\n",
        "When $a = 0$, the Taylor series is called the **Maclaurin series**:\n",
        "\n",
        "$f(x) = f(0) + \\frac{f'(0)}{1!}x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \\cdots$\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common Maclaurin series expansions:\n",
        "- $e^x = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\cdots$\n",
        "- $\\sin(x) = x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\cdots$\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Convergence of Taylor Series**\n",
        "Not all functions have a Taylor series that converges to the function for all values of $x$. The **radius of convergence** of the Taylor series is the distance from the center of expansion $a$ to the nearest singularity of the function in the complex plane. The Taylor series converges within this radius.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Absolute Convergence**: The Taylor series converges to the function if the series converges absolutely at $x$.\n",
        "- **Interval of Convergence**: The interval within which the Taylor series converges to the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Error in Approximation (Lagrange Remainder)**\n",
        "The remainder term (or error) in approximating $f(x)$ by truncating the Taylor series after $n$ terms is given by the **Lagrange form** of the remainder:\n",
        "\n",
        "$R_n(x) = \\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x - a)^{n+1}$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where $c$ is some point between $a$ and $x$. The remainder provides an estimate of the error in the approximation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Practical Use**\n",
        "- **Approximation**: Taylor series is often used to approximate functions that are difficult to compute exactly, especially for small values of $x$.\n",
        "- **Solving Differential Equations**: Taylor series is useful for solving linear ordinary differential equations near an equilibrium point.\n"
