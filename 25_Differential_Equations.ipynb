        "\n",
        "#### 1. **What is a Differential Equation?**\n",
        "A **differential equation** is an equation that involves an unknown function and its derivatives. These equations describe the relationship between a function and the rates at which it changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)**: Involves derivatives with respect to a single variable (usually time).\n",
        "- **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)**: Involves partial derivatives with respect to more than one variable (e.g., time and space).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Types of Differential Equations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Order**: The highest derivative in the equation.\n",
        "  - *First-order* equations involve the first derivative.\n",
        "  - *Second-order* equations involve the second derivative, and so on.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Linearity**:\n",
        "  - A differential equation is **linear** if the unknown function and its derivatives appear to the power of one (i.e., no products or powers of the function or its derivatives).\n",
        "  - **Nonlinear** if there are products, powers, or other nonlinear terms involving the function or its derivatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Homogeneous vs Non-homogeneous**:\n",
        "  - A differential equation is **homogeneous** if every term involves the function or its derivatives.\n",
        "  - It is **non-homogeneous** if there is an additional non-zero term (often referred to as the forcing term or external function).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **General Solution & Particular Solution**\n",
        "- **General Solution**: The most general form of the solution, typically involving arbitrary constants.\n",
        "- **Particular Solution**: A solution obtained by substituting specific values for constants based on initial/boundary conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Methods of Solving Differential Equations**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Separation of Variables**: For separable equations of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)h(y)$, you can separate the variables and integrate both sides.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Integrating Factor**: Used to solve linear first-order ODEs of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$. Multiply the equation by an integrating factor to make the left-hand side an exact derivative.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Homogeneous Equations**: For higher-order linear ODEs, solving homogeneous equations often involves finding characteristic equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Characteristic Equation (Linear ODEs)**: For linear differential equations with constant coefficients, the characteristic equation is obtained by assuming a solution of the form $y = e^{rx}$, leading to a polynomial equation for $r$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Variation of Parameters**: Used for non-homogeneous linear ODEs, this method involves using the solution of the homogeneous equation and adjusting parameters to account for the non-homogeneous part.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Laplace Transform**: A powerful tool for solving linear ODEs, especially with initial conditions. It transforms the ODE into an algebraic equation in the complex $s$-domain, which is easier to solve.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Numerical Methods**: When analytical solutions are difficult or impossible, methods like Euler’s method, Runge-Kutta methods, or finite difference methods can be used to approximate solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Example of a First-Order ODE (Separation of Variables)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   - $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{y}{x} \\quad \\text{(Separable)}$\n",
        "   Step-by-step solution:\n",
        "   - Rewrite as $\\frac{dy}{y} = \\frac{dx}{x}$.\n",
        "   - Integrate both sides: $\\int \\frac{dy}{y} = \\int \\frac{dx}{x}$, yielding:\n",
        "   $\\ln|y| = \\ln|x| + C$\n",
        "   - Exponentiate both sides to solve for $y$:\n",
        "   $y = Cx$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Second-Order Linear Differential Equations**\n",
        "   A general second-order linear ODE:\n",
        "   $a(x) \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} + c(x) y = f(x)$\n",
        "\n",
        "   Where $a(x)$, $b(x)$, and $c(x)$ are functions of $x$, and $f(x)$ is a given function.\n",
        "   - **Homogeneous Case** $f(x) = 0$:\n",
        "\n",
        "     $a(x) \\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + b(x) \\frac{dy}{dx} + c(x) y = 0$\n",
        "     - Solutions typically involve characteristic equations for constant coefficients.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - **Non-Homogeneous Case** $f(x) \\neq 0$:\n",
        "     Use **method of undetermined coefficients** or **variation of parameters** for specific solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. **Systems of Differential Equations**\n",
        "   - **Coupled Equations**: A system of two or more equations involving multiple dependent variables.\n",
        "     - Example:\n",
        "       $\\frac{dx}{dt} = y, \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} = -x$\n",
        "     - The system describes a harmonic oscillator, which has sinusoidal solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 8. **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Form**: A PDE involves partial derivatives of an unknown function with respect to more than one independent variable.\n",
        "  - Example: Heat equation, wave equation, Laplace equation.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Solution Methods**:\n",
        "  - **Separation of Variables**: Separate the spatial and time variables.\n",
